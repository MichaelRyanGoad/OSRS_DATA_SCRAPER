# OSRS_DATA_SCRAPER

This project does two things.

1. Scrapes area requirement data for quests from the following url and stores it in a dictionary:
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Trailblazer_League/Guide/Quests

2. Combines that data to edit the source code on this page
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quest_experience_rewards?oldid=13792485

My final results can be seen here:
